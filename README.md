# Pirate Themed Turn-Based Game

## Game Description

The game is turn-based, and you have a ship located on a grid (board).
The ship can move up, down, or diagonally by one square, or simply shoot.
The ship also has a direction that matches the last direction it traveled.
Shooting is to the right and left at a 90-degree angle.

Enemy ships are scattered randomly on the board and move randomly.
In the future, we will add ships with a smarter algorithm.
